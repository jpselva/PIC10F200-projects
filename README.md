# PIC10F200-projects
## Purpose
These are my solutions to the PIC10F200 microcontroller tutorials at [circuitbread.com](https://www.circuitbread.com/tutorials/series/microcontroller-basics). I mostly write the code before reading each tutorial completely, so the result won't be identical to their solution.

If you follow the tutorials, you'll probably know what each folder refers to.

This is still WIP, I'll add other stuff beyond these solutions in the future.
